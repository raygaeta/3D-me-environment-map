For this project, I had to blend and bake custom animations while integrating an environment map to create a cohesive 3D scene. One of the standout challenges was 3D scanning myself to craft the digital double, which added a personal touch and required effort beyond my computer. I also used the GroundedSkybox to anchor the model to the ground, making it appear as if it naturally existed within the virtual environment. Fine-tuning the HDR environment setup to achieve realistic shadows and lighting took time, but seeing the final result of my animated 3D self placed  in virtual nature was incredibly rewarding.
